# Summary

We are going to be creating our own ride sharing service, RUber!  There is a lot of data that needs to be managed because we are going to have like a billion users within a month.  We have a crack team of Redwood alumni already building the front end, so you need to focus on the back end of this revolutionary app.

# Technologies

The data is pretty simple and we want scalability and flexibility above all else so we are going to use NodeJs. Nearly all of our use of the data will be in basic inserts and reads.  Perfect for an API!


# Timeframe

You have about a day (+- 2 days) to build the entire backend for RUber.  

# Backlog

Here is a backlog that our team of investors has created for you to complete:

The backlog can also be found here: (https://trello.com/b/7GZJHzqm/ruber) .  You can copy this board to your own board to track your progress.
